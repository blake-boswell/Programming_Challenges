# Programming_Challenges

## My solutions to UVa programming challenges. Some solutions may be implemented in multiple languages, but most likely only one worked and I switched midway.
## WARNING: Code may be disgusting because of requirements for java files to run on UVa judge, or for sloppily quick solutions to problems.
